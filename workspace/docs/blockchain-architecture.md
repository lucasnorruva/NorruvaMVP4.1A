# Advanced Blockchain Architecture for Digital Product Passport (DPP)

This document outlines the proposed smart contract and governance architecture for the Norruva Digital Product Passport system. The design leverages an ERC-721 token to represent each passport and an ERC-20 governance token for the DAO.

## Smart Contracts

### DPP Token (ERC-721)
- Implemented in Solidity using OpenZeppelin contracts (`ERC721Upgradeable`, `ERC721URIStorageUpgradeable`, `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`).
- Upgradeable via the UUPS proxy pattern, with upgrades authorized by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
- Each token ID (`tokenId`) represents a unique Digital Product Passport.
- Minting of new tokens is restricted to accounts with the `MINTER_ROLE`.
- Metadata hash updates for a token are restricted to the token owner or accounts with the `UPDATER_ROLE`.
- By default, tokens are "soulbound" (non-transferable by the owner). Transfers can only be initiated by an account holding the `TRANSFER_ROLE` (e.g., the DAO's Timelock contract after a successful governance vote) via the `daoTransfer` function.
- The `tokenURI` function constructs the metadata URI using a prefix (e.g., `"mock-uri-prefix:"`) and the stored `metadataHash` for the token.

        return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);
    }

    // Custom event for metadata hash updates
    event MetadataUpdate(uint256 indexed _tokenId, string _oldMetadataHash, string _newMetadataHash);
}
```

**Events Emitted by `DPPToken.sol`:**
Standard ERC721 events:
- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId)`
- `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId)` (Note: `approve` is reverted, so this event will not be emitted for direct approvals)
- `ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved)` (Note: `setApprovalForAll` is reverted, so this event will not be emitted)

AccessControl events:
- `RoleAdminChanged(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed previousAdminRole, bytes32 indexed newAdminRole)`
- `RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)`
- `RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)`

Custom events:
- `MetadataUpdate(uint256 indexed _tokenId, string _oldMetadataHash, string _newMetadataHash)`

**Roles:**
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can grant/revoke roles and authorize contract upgrades.
- `MINTER_ROLE`: Can mint new DPP tokens.
- `UPDATER_ROLE`: Can update the metadata hash of any token. Token owners can also update their own token's metadata.
- `TRANSFER_ROLE`: Can initiate token transfers via the `daoTransfer` function, bypassing the default soulbound restriction. This role is typically granted to the DAO's Timelock contract.

Conceptual lifecycle states for a DPP (e.g., `Draft`, `Issued`, `Verified`, `Expired`) are managed off-chain within the Norruva platform and reflected in the DPP data, rather than being direct states within this `DPPToken` contract.

### NORU Token (ERC-20)
- Used for governance, validator staking, and compliance fees.
- Fixed initial supply with capped emissions controlled by the DAO.
- Optional staking module for auditors and verifiers.
- Manufacturers are rewarded with NORU for submitting compliant passports.
- Small NORU amounts are burned on metadata updates or lifecycle changes.

## DAO Governance

- `GovernorBravo` pattern with NORU as the voting token.
- Proposals can approve auditors, penalize bad actors, or enable token transfers (by calling `daoTransfer` on `DPPToken` via the Timelock).
- On-chain voting is complemented by Snapshot for low-cost off-chain polls.
- A multisig (e.g., Gnosis Safe) executes upgrades and other high-value actions.

## Wallet Integration

- Supports MetaMask and WalletConnect using `ethers.js` or `viem`.
- Implements EIP-1271 for contract-based wallets.
- Custodial options include services like Privy or Web3Auth.
- Sign-In With Ethereum (EIP-4361) is exchanged for Firebase JWTs on the backend.

## Off-chain Metadata Storage

- Metadata is stored in JSON-LD or W3C VC format on IPFS or Arweave.
- The smart contract records a `metadataHash` which conceptually would be the CID.
- Backend services sign the metadata and publish it when passports are created or updated.

## Backend APIs

Next.js API routes act as middleware between the frontend and the blockchain.
Important routes include:
- `/api/v1/token/mint/{productId}` (to trigger the `mint` function on `DPPToken.sol`)
- `/api/v1/token/metadata/{tokenId}` (to trigger `updateMetadataHash` on `DPPToken.sol`)
- Conceptual endpoint to trigger `daoTransfer` after a DAO vote.

Each route validates nonces and signatures to prevent replay attacks.

## Traceability

Every significant action (minting, metadata update, transfer) emits an event on the `DPPToken` contract, which can be indexed by TheGraph or other services. The frontend displays a timeline based on these events to provide an audit trail.

## Future Enhancements

- Verifiable Credentials that conform to EBSI standards for richer on-chain/off-chain claims.
- Zero-knowledge proofs for origin verification and confidential supplier data.
- NFC or QR codes that resolve to the `tokenURI` for physical product tags.
